# AeroE Math Analysis

This repository contains my work supporting the SEDS Rocketry Division at ASU.  

## Completed Work

So far, my work has focused on:
- Classifying flight phases (launch, ascent, descent, landing) using barometric altitude, velocity, and acceleration data.
- Detecting and visualizing flight phase transitions using barometric altitude, velocity, and acceleration.
- Comparing calmness metrics between Mach 0.3–0.6 and 0.6–0.7 to select a baseline for anomaly detection.
- Detecting pressure anomalies in Mach 0.7–0.78 using statistical baselining and IsolationForest.
- Identifying 5 high-confidence pressure spike events confirmed by multiple sensors (pressure, acceleration, gyro) that could affect parachute deployment.
