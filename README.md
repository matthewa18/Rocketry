# AeroE Math Analysis

This repository contains my work supporting the SEDS Rocketry Division at ASU.  

## Completed Work

So far, my work has focused on:
- Classifying flight phases (launch, ascent, descent, landing)
- Detecting and visualizing flight phase transitions using barometric altitude, velocity, and acceleration

## What's Next

The next step in this project is to explore:
- Detection of transonic shockwaves and anomalies using statistical or machine learning methods
- The goal is to identify pressure spikes in barometric data that could interfere with parachute deployment logic
